# Abandoned Food Ordering Kiosk

After learning the fundamentals of web development, I wanted to find out if I
could work professionally in the field. Before trying this project I learned:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Single Page Web Apps without a framework
5. Node
6. React
7. MongoDB
8. PostgreSQL
9. TypeScript
10. SCSS
11. Nextjs

That's quite a lot!

These were learned because I like learning, and figuring out how the web works
was fascinating.

## Is web development a good career choice for me?

After learning all of these tools, I wanted to find out the burning question:

```
Is web development a good career choice for me?

```

The way I decided to answer it, is to make a full web app just for fun. If
working as a web developer, an employee is given a task to work on something,
and they are expected to make reasonable progress on it. If doing regular
day-to-day work, the expectation is that someone doesn't end up stressed,
hating the work, or returning home regretting their day.

I figure that I would make a food ordering kiosk for different food and drinks.
I would assign myself 2 hours a day to work on this project, and replicate a
work-like experience on a simple project that could have real-world uses.

That is what this project is.

## What's the verdict?

What I found out, is that I am not suited for professional web development. I
found that I was forcing myself to work on the project, disliking the work that
I was doing. I was getting behind my regular pace of work, and feeling the
stress of not getting an acceptable amount of work done per day. As days passed,
I would get more behind, and would dislike the work more and more.

If you are wondering what I consider an acceptable amount of work per day, that
is where I code between 30 minutes and 1 hour per day, in a two hour day, to
account for time spent reading docs and learning. I don't consider time reading
documentation to eventually finish a function, or SCSS style, to be time wasted.

## What does this mean for web dev?

This means that I can do web dev work over a short time. If I work somewhere,
and I am tasked with changing the color of a button, or get a function to work
with an API, that is something I can do as one-off work. But it is not
professional work I would be able to do every day. I would burn out fast.
Perhaps, I could cover someone for a sick day for a day or two, while working
on other coding projects for a company or organization as my main job.

This means web dev is not satisfying work for me. Even though I really like
coding and enjoy the problem solving process and getting work done.

## How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Being a Hobbyist

Inside this GitHub account, you'll find other web dev related projects that I
work on and enjoyed. These include:
- A collection of simple web apps made using [vanilla tools](https://github.com/DarrylDalesandry/vanilla-web-apps)
- A single page web app of calculators, [with no framework](https://github.com/DarrylDalesandry/generation-of-calculators)

These two projects were fun for me to work on.

In the calculator app, I liked taking inspiration from the functional
programming paradigm to write my own split function, and passing the output to
other functions that would solve math equations in the order of operations. I
liked coding the easter egg with the solar cells on the calculator.

In the single page app, I had a good time making the logic of what parts of a
web page to update based on state, or the key-value pairs of an object. I also
liked using CSS to make different designs of the page at different pixel
widths.

For all of you reading this:
**I don't hate web development, I am simply not able to do the work professionally**

What this ultimately means, is that I can be a hobbyist web developer. I can
make my own personal projects and enjoy what I am working on for myself. In a
professional workplace, I could also make simple web apps simply for me, and to
make other development work easier or to have something that the office could
use to make work more fun.

I'm happy with that.
